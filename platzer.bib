  abstract  = {
    We generalise dynamic logic to a logic for
    differential-algebraic programs, i.e., discrete
    programs augmented with first-order
    differential-algebraic formulas as continuous evolution
    constraints in addition to first-order discrete jump
    formulas. These programs characterise interacting
    discrete and continuous dynamics of hybrid systems
    elegantly and uniformly. For our logic, we introduce a
    calculus over real arithmetic with discrete induction
    and a new differential induction with which
    differential-algebraic programs can be verified by
    exploiting their differential constraints algebraically
    without having to solve them. We develop the theory of
    differential induction and differential refinement and
    analyse their deductive power. As a case study, we
    present parametric tangential roundabout maneuvers in
    air traffic control and prove collision avoidance in
    our calculus.},

  abstract  = {
    Hybrid systems are models for complex physical systems
    and are defined as dynamical systems with interacting
    discrete transitions and continuous evolutions along
    differential equations. With the goal of developing a
    theoretical and practical foundation for deductive
    verification of hybrid systems, we introduce a dynamic
    logic for hybrid programs, which is a program notation
    for hybrid systems. As a verification technique that is
    suitable for automation, we introduce a free variable
    proof calculus with a novel combination of real-valued
    free variables and Skolemisation for lifting quantifier
    elimination for real arithmetic to dynamic logic. The
    calculus is compositional, i.e., it reduces properties
    of hybrid programs to properties of their parts. Our
    main result proves that this calculus axiomatises the
    transition behaviour of hybrid systems completely
    relative to differential equations. In a case study
    with cooperating traffic agents of the European Train
    Control System, we further show that our calculus is
    well-suited for verifying realistic hybrid systems with
    parametric system dynamics.
